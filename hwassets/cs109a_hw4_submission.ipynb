    "\n",
    "A: Without a shrinkage penalty, the coefficients are exactly the same as those estimated by a plain linear regression except for two. The coefficients for holiday and workingday differ between all three regressions and we were not able to figure out the reason for this differentiation. We went to several office hours and made a Piazza post, but we weren't able to find an answer. Other than those two coefficients there is no difference between the coefficients estimated by the two different shrinkage methods.\n",

    "Q: List the predictors that are assigned a coefficient value close to 0 (say < 1e-10) by the two methods. How closely do these predictors match the redundant predictors (if any) identified in Part (c) from HW 3?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Predictors with coefficients close to 0: workingday, summer, Feb, Mar, May, Wed, Thurs. Not all of these values match those we found in HW 3, but several do. Redundant predictors that do match are: summer, Feb, Mar, and May.\n",

    "Q: Is there a difference in the way Ridge and Lasso regression assign coefficients to the predictors temp and atemp? If so, explain the reason for the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "A: For the regressions with no lambdas there is no difference in the way that Ridge and Lasso assign coefficients to temp and atemp. When we did the cross validation, however, it seems that the Lasso regression assigned each of them lower values and also reduced the difference between the two (Ridge: 810 and 389 vs. Lasso: 608 and 467). I \n",
    "\n",
    "<hr />\n",
    "Q: How do the training and test $R^2$ scores compare for the three methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Lasso had the lowest R^2 values of all three and the linear and ridge regressions were very similar. I believe that this similarity is due to the fact that the cross validation selected a lambda that is very close to 0, so the Ridge Regression is very close to being a simple linear regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "<hr />\n",
    "Q: How do the confidence intervals for the estimated $R^2$ change with training sample size?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: In general, the higher the sample size was, the smaller the confidence interval got, although there are some clear exceptions to this on my graph.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<hr />\n",
    "Q: Based on the plots, which of the three methods would you recommend when one needs to fit a regression model using a small training sample?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: We would recommend using a linear regression with a small training sample, because the Lasso confidence intervals were quite wide and the Ridge regression simply did the same thing as a linear regression. \n",

    "Because we know that the information in y_test is accurate, we could compare the distribution of y_test to the distribution of y_train to see which 5% is most likely erroneous. This approach, however, would leak data out of the test set and into the training set, which would mean that our model would be fitting to the validation set and therefore our validation would not provide a reliable picture of our model working on something out of sample. Without taking into account the distribution of y_test, we might try to eliminate that 5% error by dropping outlier predictions or weighting them less the farther they are from the mean. However, this approach does not make much sense, because the erroneous data could be anywhere in the distribution, not just far from the mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "We decided that our best option was to try and penalize outlier values of y_train, because we didn't want to leak from our validation set. In order to implement this we used the same method that we did for the RMSLE and changed the sample_weight of a linear regression model. We weighted each value so that values would have less weight if the error for the model in part g was large. There is a risk in doing this that we overfit to the training data, but our R^2 on the testing data was almost as good as our R^2 for part g, so we know that we haven't overfit to the training data too much."

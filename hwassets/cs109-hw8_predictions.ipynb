    "# Higgs Boson Discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "The discovery of the Higgs boson in July 2012 marked a fundamental breakthrough in particle physics. The Higgs boson particle was discovered through experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, by colliding beams of protons at high energy. A key challenge in analyzing the results of these experiments is to differentiate between a collision that produces Higgs bosons and collisions thats produce only background noise. We shall explore the use of ensemble methods for this classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are provided with data from Monte-Carlo simulations of collisions of particles in a particle collider experiment. The training set is available in `Higgs_train.csv` and the test set is in `Higgs_test.csv`. Each row in these files corresponds to a particle colision described by 28 features (columns 1-28), of which the first 21 features are kinematic properties measured by the particle detectors in the accelerator, and the remaining features are derived by physicists from the the first 21 features. The class label is provided in the last column, with a label of 1 indicating that the collision produces Higgs bosons (signal), and a label of 0 indicating that the collision produces other particles (background). \n",
    "\n",
    "The data set provided to you is a small subset of the HIGGS data set in the UCI machine learning repository. The following paper contains further details about the data set and the predictors used: <a href = \"https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5308\">Baldi et al., Nature Communications 5, 2014</a>.\n"

    "## Question 2 (15pt): Dropout-based Approach\n",
    "We start with a simple method inspired from the idea of 'dropout' in machine learning, where we fit multiple decision trees on random subsets of predictors, and combine them through a majority vote. The procedure is described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each predictor in the training sample, set the predictor values to 0 with probability $p$  (i.e. drop the predictor by setting it to 0). Repeat this for $B$ trials to create $B$ separate training sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fit decision tree models $\\hat{h}^1(x), \\ldots, \\hat{h}^B(x) \\in \\{0,1\\}$ to the $B$ training sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Combine the decision tree models into a single classifier by taking a majority vote:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{H}_{maj}(x) \\,=\\, majority\\Big(\\hat{h}^1(x), \\ldots, \\hat{h}^B(x)\\Big).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall refer to the combined classifier as an ** *ensemble classifier* **. Implement the described dropout approach, and answer the following questions:\n",
    "1. Apply the dropout procedure with $p = 0.5$ for different number of trees (say $2, 4, 8, 16, \\ldots, 256$), and evaluate the training and test accuracy of the combined classifier. Does an increase in the number of trees improve the training and test performance? Explain your observations in terms of the bias-variance trade-off for the classifier.\n",
    "- Fix the number of trees to 64 and apply the dropout procedure with different dropout rates $p = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9$. Based on your results, explain how the dropout rate influences the bias and variance of the combined classifier.\n",
    "- Apply 5-fold cross-validation to choose the optimal combination of the dropout rate and number of trees. How does the test performance of an ensemble of trees fitted with the optimal dropout rate and number of trees compare with the single decision tree model in Question 1?\n",
    "[hint: Training with large number of trees can take long time. You may need to restrict the max number of trees.]"

    "We've worked with imputation methods on missing data in Homework 6.  We've worked with Decision Trees in HW7 and here.  Now let's see what happens if we try to work with Decision Trees and Missing Data at the same time! We'll be working with a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository that uses a variety of wine chemical predictors to classify wines grown in the same region in Italy.  Each line represents 13 (mostly chemical) predictors of the response variable wine class, including things like alcohol content, hue , and phenols.  Unfortunately some of the predictor values were lost in measurement. Please load `wine_quality_missing.csv`. \n",

Use cross-validation to find the optimal tree depth for each method.  Report the optimal tree-depth, overall classification rate and confusion matrix on the test set for each method.\n",
    "2. Restart with a fresh copy of the data and impute the missing data via mean imputation.  Split the data 75-25 and again fit DecisionTreeClassifier and RandomForestClassifier using cross-validation to find the optimal tree depth.  Report the optimal tree depth, overall classification rate and confusion matrix on the test set for each method.  \n",
    "3. Again restart with a fresh copy of the data but this time let's try something different.  As discussed in section, CART Decision Trees can take advantage of surrogate splits to handle missing data.  Split the data 75-25 and construct a **custom** decision tree model and train it on the training set with missing data. Report the optimal tree depth, overall classification rate and confusion matrix on the test set and compare your results to the Imputation and DecisionTree model results in part 1 & 2.\n"
